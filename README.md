# retro_tas
General purpose tools to help with [tool-assisted speedrunning](https://tasvideos.org/).

Currently, this includes two scripts:
- retro_tas.lua: general purpose functions for well-aligned pixel text display and pointer dereferencing
- rewind_rerecords.lua: count rerecords during rewind in BizHawk, which is [not a feature of BizHawk itself yet](https://github.com/TASEmulators/BizHawk/issues/3707)

Called 'Retro TAS' because I'm so egotistical I named the project after myself. (Actually, I originally called this 'TAS tools' locally, but that name has already been used and is overall kind of generic. Although perhaps 'Retro TAS' is not much better in some ways.)
